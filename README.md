## Project Setup

Download and install:

* [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 6.9.5
* npm >= 4.1.2
  * `sudo npm i -g npm@latest` after installing node

### Frontend

Running `npm run dev` will watch all files in *javascript/* for changes, and recompile
*bundle.js*. You can also run `npm run build` to produce a minified version of the bundle.

## Backend
Go to the directory *starter* and type in `make`
    Notes: Make sure you have Maven installed.
If anything breaks, check that the *pom.xml* has all the dependencies.
Procfile has the Heroku deployment (subject to change)

*tut-react-and-spring-data-rest* is a sample finished app to show how React interacts. Has a `Makefile` as well that you can run to see how it is deployed.
